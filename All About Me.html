		<h1>All About Emily</h1>
		</div>
			<article>My name is Emily, as obviously shown at the top of the page. 
				<section> E: extra annoying   M: mega sleepy  I:  intelligent (sometimes)  L: laughing fool  Y: yellow sunshine

				<p>I have really no idea what I'm doing in this class. This is my first time doing anything like this, but I really am not looking forward to carrying around that book all the time. It's huge, and that's saying something because I love books and read them all the time. I like reading big books, but that is just insane. I honestly thought this class was something completely else, but I guess I'll just have to survive. 
				 <span> I am a big dummy who gets super confused super easily too, so I have a feeling I'm going to be that one student that asks a bunch of stupid questions because I don't understand what's happening. This is going to be kind of hard class for me to do. It's been a while since I've started something I have literally no experience in, so I'm gonna have to approach this differently from my other classes.</span>

		<h2>A Little bit About my Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I enjoy reading quite a lot. I usually have a book of some sort with me and have done so since middle school. I also enjoy playing older games such as the GameCube or PS 1 games. Rayman is one of my favorites. I also watch a lot of movies. Mostly Disney and family movies. I can quote those so much. Can't name any actors hardly to save my life though.</p>

		<h3>How I'll do in Class</h3>
	<conclusion> <p>I am going to try my best in this class. Just like I do for all my other classes. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I don't plan on quiting any time soon. Thankfully one of my friends is really good at this kind of thing too, so he can help me when I need it. My problem is going to likely be how well I take my notes. I can't write legibly all that fast. I wish I could, but I really can't. I guess I'll just have to try a little bit harder.</p>
	<span> I understand the stuff I was told on Monday pretty well though, which is surprising considering how fast we went through everything. Thank goodness I found a notebook to write everything in. I'll have to remember to bring one every day so I can take more notes. But I will do my best in this class. </span>
