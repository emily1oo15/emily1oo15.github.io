				<article> Articles are a way of giving information. They usually include sections like this:
					<section id= mysection> Sections and articles tend to switch depending on the person's preferences and beliefs. The id allows me to reference within the page<br>
					&copy;    This is the copyright symbol
					&lt;/section&gt;  <br>
					Something <sup>1</sup>
					5<sup>3</sup> * 10<sup>7</sup>
					</section>

			<p> is for paragraph. It will put everything I need into a paragraph <br>
			br is going down to the next line. <br>
				<img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="website coding image" /> <br>
			When putting in an image, make sure that you put the folder name, and the image itself in the "". For example, this image was found in my images folder (in the github1) and the name of the image is coding.jpg
