	body
	{
		background-color:#e5e5e5;
		color:#191970;
	}
	</style> styles allow me to change the colors of certain parts of the page. I can either change the entire background, or I can just do certain parts of the page. Typically don't put in the head, and also typically just use css links. When using a font family, if the font is more than one word, always put it in "" 
	fonts.google.com
	<title> Tab Name </title>
			<meta charset = "utf-8" /> charset means font <br>
			<!--This is a comment (usually used for name and date) -->
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/exAmple.css" /> 
			Every time you want to link anything you have to put a link tag in front and at the end. When you are inputting a style, you do the same thing you would with a picture.
		<nav>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.otc.edu" "target="_blank" >OTC</a> This is a website. The target part only needs to be added if you want to open a "website within a website."</li>
				<li><a href="page2.html" target="_self">Page 2</a> This adds the page link going to a different page. .html always does this. It leads to another html page.</li>
				<li><a href="#mysection">The Section</a></li>
				<li> li stands for 'list.' Always make sure to put them between the ul. ol instead of li will make them numbers rather than bullets.
			</ul class:"contactInfo">
		</nav>
			<ol style="color:#pink;"> the style here allows me to change the font color of just the ols
				<li><a href="mailto:wrighta@otc.edu">Aaron's Email</a> This is adding in an email.</li>
				<li><a href="tel:"+14174477500"> (417)447-7500</a> This is adding a phone number.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin: 5px"> Downloads
					<a href="All About Me.html">first assignment as an example</a>
				<li style="margin: 25px">
					 margins put it at a certain part of the page
			</ul>
			<dl>
				<dt>HTML</dt>
				<dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
				<dt>dt and dd</dt>
				<dd> dl is the heading or term for the dd or description. Like for an index.
			<dl>
	</head>
		<h1> Example </h1>
	<body> Everything in between
			<!--This is how you change your background color -->
			<div id="container">
				<span> inside a div </span>
			</div>
				<article class="backgroundPurple" style="color:#FFB6C1"> Articles are a way of giving information. They usually include sections like this:
					<section id= mysection> Sections and articles tend to switch depending on the person's preferences and beliefs. The id allows me to reference within the page<br>
					&copy;    This is the copyright symbol
					&lt;/section&gt;  <br>
					Something <sup>1</sup>
					5<sup>3</sup> * 10<sup>7</sup>
					</section>
				<nav>
				</article> class references your . in the css page
			<p> is for paragraph. It will put everything I need into a paragraph <br>
			br is going down to the next line. <br>
				<img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="website coding image" /> <br>
			When putting in an image, make sure that you put the folder name, and the image itself in the "". For example, this image was found in my images folder (in the github1) and the name of the image is coding.jpg

		<h2> each heading number is a different size, but don't use them just for their sizes</h2>
		<h3> Always make sure to use them in the correct order 1, 2, 3 </h3>
			<aside> Asides are always connected to the content, but not absolutely needed
